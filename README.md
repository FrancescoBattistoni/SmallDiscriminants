# SmallDiscriminants
This repository contains the PARI/GP programs written by Francesco Battistoni in order to classify number fields with small discriminant of degree 8 and 9 in several signatures. The results obtained thanks to these programs are collected in the paper "On small discriminants of number fields of degree 8 and 9"
